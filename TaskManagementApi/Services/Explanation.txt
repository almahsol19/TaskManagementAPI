Explanation of Changes:
1. async/await: The await keyword was added to ensure that asynchronous operations complete correctly.
			 Without await, these methods would run synchronously, which is not what we want for async database queries.
2. Return type changes: Since FirstOrDefaultAsync and ToListAsync are asynchronous methods,
					 the methods GetTask and GetAllTasks return Task<Task> and Task<List<Task>>, respectively, instead of returning the result directly.
3. Error handling: A try-catch block was added to catch any potential exceptions,
				such as database connection issues or errors while executing the queries.
